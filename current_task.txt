Now, back to the original log file parsing. Some of the files may not be as "clean".

FATAL: The plots don't get generated for fewer lines!

1. Some may contain a few empty lines, which have to be ignored.
2. All the events may not be classified into E1-E6. Such events have to be put inside "other".

Implement these atleast for now.
