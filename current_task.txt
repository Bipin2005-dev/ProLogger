Now, I need to create the navigation bar. I think, by the way the website works, the nav bar should only appear once I have uploaded the log file.
Let the colour of the bar be grey, include the links to the index page, the tables page, as well as the graphs page.

The nav bar shouldn't be accessible the first time the user comes. Probably keep a variable signifying the file upload, and only allow access to it if a file is uploaded.
